                            <p>I offer both individual critiques and 1 on 1 tutoring sessions covering a variety of topics including:</p>
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                            
                            <h2>Individual Recorded Video Critique - $50 USD</h2>
                            <p>Each recorded critique includes up to 30 minutes of review time on a demo reel, piece of animation, or a topic of your choosing.  A private vimeo link will be provided allowing you to view the critique indefinitely.</p> 
                            
                            <sub><p><i>* Actual length of critique varies based on submission.</i></p></sub>
                            
                            <h2>6 Week Personalized Tutoring Program - $750 USD</h2>
                            <p>Any skill level is welcome, from beginner to advanced. Each 6 week tutorship is personalized to the artist's skill level and interest. While a demo reel is not required to sign up, having some sort of work to show me will help accurately develop a course of action for our time together.</p>

                            <p>From the beginning, we will work together to develop a completed animation (or more) from conception to completion. We will start with an idea, develop the concept, make a realistic course of action, and complete a polished animation (or more!) during the 6 weeks. When signing up, we will work together to establish a schedule that fits your needs and both our availability. </p>

                            <p>If you are an absolute beginner, we will start with the basics, covering each of the 12 principles of animation; each week focusing on a new topic in addition to learning the basics of Maya. If you are more advanced, we can focus on a specific dialogue piece, an action sequence, or creature and it's behavior. </p>

                            <p>Feedback during the 6 weeks is solely based around your schedule. You can submit work to me daily, weekly, or monthly. This allows for a great deal of schedule flexibility allowing you to have time for work, school, family, etc. One annotated video critique is usually provided per week in conjunction with emailed written notes and/or google chat feedback if you submit more often. I will usually have notes for you within 24 hours or less of your submission. </p>

                            <p>Want to send a WIP version of your assignment every other day? No problem! I'll provide written notes for you or we can chat online if the time difference allows. Rather submit only every week? That's fine too. Unlike most online courses, feedback is open ended and based solely around your schedule. I'm here to help you succeed and learn, this method also helps mimic dailies and how feedback works in a real studio. </p>
                            
                            <sub><i>** While no experience is necessary for the 6 weeks, it is highly recommended to have a basic introductory level of knowledge in Maya and what 3D animation entails.</i></sub>

                            <p>Have a question? Browse below and hopefully it can be answered. If not, please feel free to drop me a line below!</p>
                            <button class="accordion">General Information</button>
                            <div class="panel">
                                    <hr>
                                   <b>Are you a school? Do you give grades or college credit?</b><br />
                                   <p>No. These critiques are simply a source for receiving honest, yet critical feedback on your animation. My goal is to include a more affordable option that would provide supplemental support to other degree programs or online animation schools. No grades, no deadlines, no provided rigs or program requirements; just honest feedback and knowledge from an industry professional on your work.</p>
                                
                                    <p></p>
                                
                                    <b>How many assignments can I work on?</b><br />
                                    <p>This depends on your skill level. A beginner may complete more smaller assignments where an intermediate or advanced student may complete one or two more complex projects. Each tutorship is custom tailored to each individual. I do suggest having two different shots to work on to maximize your time and money spent; this way when you are waiting on feedback for one project, you have something else to work on.</p>

                                    <b>Are there any live lectures or meetings?</b><br />
                                    <p>Unfortunately, No. All video feedback is pre-recorded and made available online for viewing via private Vimeo link. Daily written critiques and Google Chat is available for the 6 week 1 on 1 tutoring sessions.</p> 

                                    <b>When is feedback given? What is the structure of the tutorship?</b><br />
                                    <p>Feedback is given whenever an assignment is submitted, generally within 24 hours. You are able to submit updates throughout the 6 weeks at your own pace. You can submit assignments every other day to once every week or once per month. 

                                    While I am not able to provide daily video critiques due to my work schedule, I will provide written feedback if you do submit more regularly. One video critique per week will be uploaded provided you submit work for review.</p>
                                
                                    <p>Please be aware that I am loacted in Vancouver, BC Canada and on Pacific Time. Chances are there will be a time difference depending on where you are in the world (perhaps an entire 8+ hours). I often check out work in the evening after 8pm PST or during my lunch in the middle of the day.</p>

                                    <b>What software is used?</b><br />
                                    <p>Maya is recommended. I will critique any animation done in any software, however I generally only use Maya so I will not be able to provide technical specific details, animation file review, or helpful tips for any other programs.</p>
                                    <p>A private Vimeo link will be provided to view each video critique.</p>
                                
                                    <b>What if I need time off? Do I lose time that I paid for?</b><br />
                                    <p>Life happens, I understand that. Please contact me if something life changing happens or if you planned on taking a vacation during the 6 weeks. I will try to do my best to accommodate you and if needed, we can shift our schedule a week or two.</p>
